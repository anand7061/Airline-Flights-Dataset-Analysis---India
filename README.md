# 🛫 Airline Flights Dataset Analysis - India

This project performs a detailed analysis of a real-world dataset containing flight booking information between various Indian cities. The dataset includes features such as airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, number of stops, seat class, flight duration, days left for travel, and ticket price.

## 📊 Objective
To explore, clean, and analyze flight data using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to uncover insights about:
- Flight delays
- Ticket pricing trends
- Cancellations (if any)
- Airline and route performance

## 📁 Dataset Description
- **Airline**: Name of the airline (6 categories)
- **Flight**: Unique flight code
- **Source & Destination City**: Cities of departure and arrival
- **Departure & Arrival Time**: Categorical bins (morning, evening, etc.)
- **Stops**: Number of stops (non-stop, 1-stop, 2+ stops)
- **Class**: Business or Economy
- **Duration**: Travel time in hours
- **Days Left**: Days remaining before the journey
- **Price**: Ticket cost (target variable)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Insights
- Price variations based on airlines and seat class
- Impact of booking window (days left) on fare
- Time-of-day trends in pricing and duration
- Airline performance by route

## 📈 Outcome
This analysis supports data-driven decision-making for travelers, agencies, and airline stakeholders. It demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills and real-world application of Python data libraries.
